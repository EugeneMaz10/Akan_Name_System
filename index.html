    <p>The <em> Akan people</em> of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they 
        were born and the order in which they were born. These <em>"day names"</em> have further 
        meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have 
        considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an 
        gancestor's middle name.</p>
